# Digit regonition system using neural network 

This is my first code of neuran network in Matlab. I used the data from Kaggle, which is pretty popular and easy to use for a biginner. I built a simple neural network to detect a digit from images. This code does not include the code of separting the trainin dataset and the test dataset. The training dataset includes data points, and the test dataset includes data points. This code is intented to show how a simple neural network works.  

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Install Matlab (obviously) 
Obtain datasets from the following link: (https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data) 
```


## Running the tests
This matlab code contains one main function and multiple function files.
```
Run proj_main.m
```

### Break down into end to end tests

First, this code loads and displays 

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
